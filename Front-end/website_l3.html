        <h2>Lesson 3: Phishing Scams</h2>
        <p>Phishing refers to attempts by scammers to steal sensitive information, such as personal details, login credentials, or financial data.</p>
        
        <div class="phishing-type">
            <img src="../images/phishing-example.jpg" alt="example of phishing" class="phishing-image">
            <p>There are four different types of phishing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="phishing-item">
                    <img src="../images/spear-phising.jpeg" alt="Spear phishing" class="inline-image">
                    <div>
                        <strong>Spear Phishing:</strong> Targets specific individuals with tailored malicious emails. 
                        These personalized scams trick victims into divulging sensitive data, downloading malware or sending money to an attacker
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li class="phishing-item">
                    <img src="../images/whaling-phishing.png" alt="whaling-phishing" class="inline-image">
                    <div>
                        <strong>Whaling:</strong> Targets business executives, celebrities, or people with large financial assets. 
                        These attacks are carefully designed to deceive top executives, such as CEOs and CFOs, into giving away sensitive information.
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li class="phishing-item">
                    <img src="../images/Smishing-phising.png" alt="Smishing-phishing" class="inline-image">
                    <div>
                        <strong>Smishing:</strong> Phishing attacks carried out via SMS. 
                        Smishing text messages are often purporting to be from your bank, asking you for personal or financial information such as your account or ATM number. Providing the information is equivalent to handing thieves the keys to your bank balance.
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li class="phishing-item">
                    <img src="../images/vishing-phishing.jpeg" alt="vishing-phishing" class="inline-image">
                    <div>
                        <strong>Vishing:</strong> Phishing attacks conducted via phone calls. 
                        Scammers who use vishing attacks commonly pretend to be respected institutions like banks or the government. They use psychological techniques to simulate urgency, often threatening legal action or claiming your account will be frozen. 
                    </div>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>When to be cautious:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="caution-item">
                <img src="../images/Broken-links.jpeg" alt="Phishing over WiFi" class="caution-image">
                <div>
                    If a website has many broken links, random pop-ups, or asks for personal information unnecessarily.
                    A broken link is when link that points to a webpage that does not exist. 
                    <br>
                    <strong>Why it's suspicious:</strong>
                    Broken links could be intentional, leading users to phishing websites designed to steal personal information or infect devices with malware. A user might click on a broken link thinking it's just an error, but it could redirect them to a malicious page.
                    <br>
                    Fake "404" Pages: Some websites use broken links as a way to direct users to fake 404 error pages that disguise malicious activities. These pages might trick users into submitting personal information, downloading malicious software, or clicking on dangerous ads.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li class="caution-item">
                <img src="../images/too-good-to-be-true.webp" alt="Phishing personal data" class="caution-image">
                <div>
                    Be skeptical of websites offering “too good to be true” deals.
                    Eg. Exclusive 90% Off Sale - Limited Time Only!
                    <br>
                    <strong>Why it’s suspicious:</strong>
                    Unrealistic pricing: Discounts that are too steep are often a sign of fraud. Genuine sales rarely offer items at such drastically reduced prices, especially high-end products.
                    <br>
                    Urgency and scarcity: The deal may come with phrases like "limited time offer," "only a few left," or "act now!" to pressure users into purchasing without thinking critically.
