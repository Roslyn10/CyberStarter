        <h2>Lesson 1: Internet Safety</h2>
        <p>Now that we understand the basics of the internet, it’s important to learn how to stay safe while using it. Here are some key tips:</p>

        <h3>1. Protect Your Personal Information</h3>
        <p>Don’t share sensitive details online like your name, address, phone number, or passwords. Avoid meeting strangers you only know online. It’s safer to communicate only with people you know personally, like friends and family. Be cautious about accepting files from unknown sources — they could contain viruses or harmful content.</p>

        <h3>2. Use Privacy Safeguards</h3>
        <p>Always turn on privacy settings on your accounts and devices to protect your personal information. Remember to log out when using shared or public devices, like school or library computers.</p>

        <h3>3. Be Smart When Browsing</h3>
        <p>Avoid suspicious sites or explicit content. If something looks unsafe and suspicious, it probably is. Download apps carefully from trusted sources, as malware can be disguised as legitimate software.</p>

        <h3>4. Secure Your Internet Connection</h3>
        <p>Use secure networks, especially when accessing private information. When using public Wi-Fi, always be cautious, and consider using a VPN for extra safety.</p>

        <h3>5. Use Strong Passwords</h3>
        <p>Create complex passwords with at least 16 characters, including numbers and special symbols. Avoid reusing the same password across multiple sites, and consider using a password manager to safely store them.</p>

        <h3>6. Shop Online Safely</h3>
        <p>Check for secure websites before entering payment details. Look for URLs that start with https instead of http.</p>

        <h3>7. Think Before You Post</h3>
        <p>Be mindful of what you share online, as it can stay there permanently. Don’t post anything you wouldn’t want others to see, and avoid sharing sensitive pictures or documents publicly.</p>

        <h3>8. Socialize with Care</h3>
        <p>Don’t trust strangers online. Cybercriminals can create fake profiles to steal personal information, so be cautious with who you interact with.</p>

        <h3>9. Stay Updated and Protected</h3>
        <p>Keep antivirus software up to date to protect against new threats. Regularly back up your data to ensure access even if your information is breached.</p>

        <h3>10. Be Cautious of Links</h3>
        <p>Don’t click on suspicious links, as they may lead to malicious websites or install malware or spyware on your device.</p>

        <h3>Common Online Threats</h3>
        <p>Be aware of potential online risks, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identity theft</li>
            <li>Data breaches</li>
            <li>Malware and viruses</li>
